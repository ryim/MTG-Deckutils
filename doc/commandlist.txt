            are not in your library or are in use in other decks.

            deckutils toget -i deckname.cod -l library.cod [-v] [-d deck1.cod
            deck2.cod deck3.cod]

    -d --decklist   List of other decks that take up cards from your library.
                    Useful if you don't want to dismantle other decks to make
                    your new one.
    -l --lib        Path to library COD file containing all of your cards
    -v --verbose    Verbose output (Does nothing at the moment)

            that are unique to each deck.

    -s --sideboard  Include sideboard in the lists of cards in each deck so
                    that each output list is more complete.
